In other words, the PDF provides the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.\n",

    "#Uniform Distribution: In a uniform distribution, all outcomes are equally likely over a specified range. For example, rolling a fair six-sided die is an example of a uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution): The normal distribution is a bell-shaped, symmetric distribution characterized by its mean (average) and standard deviation. Many natural phenomena follow this distribution, such as heights or test scores.\n",

    "#Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (experiments with two possible outcomes, usually success or failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "#Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution models the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of time or space when the events are rare but random. It's often used for count data, such as the number of phone calls at a call center in a given hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Exponential Distribution: The exponential distribution models the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur randomly at a constant average rate. It's commonly used for modeling lifetimes, waiting times, and reliability.\n",

    "#Gamma Distribution: The gamma distribution is a versatile distribution used for modeling waiting times, sums of exponential random variables, and other continuous positive variables. It includes the exponential distribution as a special case.\n",

    "#Weibull Distribution: The Weibull distribution is often used in reliability engineering and life data analysis to model the distribution of lifetimes of products or systems.\n",

    "#Log-Normal Distribution: The log-normal distribution is characterized by its logarithm being normally distributed. It's used for modeling variables that are inherently positive and have skewed distributions, such as stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Beta Distribution: The beta distribution is commonly used to model random variables that have a limited range, such as proportions or probabilities. It has two shape parameters that can make it symmetrical or skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Cauchy Distribution: The Cauchy distribution has heavy tails and lacks finite moments (mean and variance). It's used in physics and some statistical applications, but it can be challenging to work with due to its heavy tails.\n",

    "#Triangular Distribution: The triangular distribution is often used when there is uncertainty about the true distribution of a variable, and only minimum, maximum, and a most likely value are known.\n",
